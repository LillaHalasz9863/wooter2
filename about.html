		<h2>Material</h2>
        <p>
         We believe sustainable handmade designs can change consumer behavior. Our innovative bottle "WOOTER" was created and developed by us, and is the world´s first handcrafted one-piece bamboo bottle with a re-usable silicone inlay and lid. Each individual bottle is hand drilled in local Indian homes, using skills passed down through families.

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>We are a Danish innovative company, founded by the international friends Natalia, Claire, Alexandra, Lilla and Jevgenia. All of us are interested in protecting and saving the enviroment. There are so much issues about that theme. We decided to make people think about their own health and also to be apart of saving the planet when they buy one of our special bamboo bottle. With so much love, patience and time we established "WOOTER" in early 2019 to fulfill people´s own needs for a sustainable, unique and reusable drinking bottle. After the success of "Wooter" and the growing interest in we realise there are loads of people who want to help our earth. </p>
